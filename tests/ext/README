Directory location for tests from external modules.

Say you have a project for a Course Builder module foo with the following
structure:

  /foo
    /src
      __init__.py
      foo.py
    /tests
      __init__.py
      foo_test.py

This directory is where you symlink your tests into your Course Builder tree so
their imports resolve neatly. The intended structure for this directory given
the module above is:

  /coursebuilder/tests/ext
    /foo
      foo_test.py

which can be achieved by symlinking from /foo/tests to
/coursebuilder/tests/ext/foo. Then, you can run your tests via

  $ coursebuilder/scripts/test.sh tests.ext.foo.foo_test

This assumes you have also symlinked from /foo/src to
/coursebuilder/modules/foo.
